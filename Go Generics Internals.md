# Performance

- **DO** try to de-duplicate identical methods that take a `string` and a `[]byte` using an `interface {~string | ~[]byte}` constraint. The generated shape instantiation is very close to manually writing two almost-identical functions
- **DO** use generics in data structures. Removing the type assertions and storing types _unboxed_ in a type-safe way makes these data structures both easier to use and more performant
- **DO** attempt to parametrize functional helpers by their callback types. In some cases, it may allow the Go compiler to flatten them
- **DO NOT** attempt to use Generics to de-virtualize or inline method calls. It doesn't work because there's a single shape for all pointer types that can be passed to the generic function; the associated method information lives in a runtime dictionary
- **DO NOT** pass an interface to a generic function. Because of the way shape instantiation works for interfaces, instead of de-virtualizing, you're adding another virtualization layer that involves a global hash table lookup for every method call. When dealing with Generics in a performance-sensitive context, use only pointers instead of interfaces
- **DO NOT** rewrite interface-based APIs to use Generics. Given the current constraints of the implementation, any code that currently uses non-empty interfaces will behave more predictably, and will be simpler, if it continues using interfaces. When it comes to method calls, Generics devolve pointers into twice-indirect interfaces
