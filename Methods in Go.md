# Method Expressions

For a type `T`, `T.M` is a function that is callable as a regular function with the same arguments as `M` prefixed by an additional argument that is the receiver of the method

For example, given:

```go
type T struct {
	a int
}
func (tv  T) Mv(a int) int         { return 0 }  // value receiver
func (tp *T) Mp(f float32) float32 { return 1 }  // pointer receiver
```

- `T.Mv` yields a function with the signature `func(tv T, a int) int`
- `(*T).Mp` yields a function with the signature `func(tp *T, f float32) float32`
- `(*T).Mv` yields a function with the signature `func(tv *T, a int) int`. This function indirects through the receiver to create a value to pass as the receiver to the underlying method
- `T.Mp` is illegal, because pointer-receiver methods are not in the method set of the value type

It is legal to derive a function value from a method of an interface type. The resulting function takes an explicit receiver of that interface type

# Method Values

If `x` has type `T`, the method value `x.M` is a function value that is callable with the same arguments as a method call of `x.M`

The expression `x` is **evaluated and saved during the evaluation of the method value**; the saved copy is then used as the receiver in any calls, which may be executed later

For example, given:

```go
type T struct {
	a int
}
func (tv  T) Mv(a int) int         { return 0 }  // value receiver
func (tp *T) Mp(f float32) float32 { return 1 }  // pointer receiver

var t T
var pt *T
```

- `t.Mv` yields a function value of type `func(int) int`
- `pt.Mp` yields a function value of type `func(float32) float32`
- `pt.Mv` is equivalent to `(*pt).Mv`
- `t.Mp` is equivalent to `(&t).Mp` if `t` is [addressable](https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Address_operators)

# Capturing Values in Closures

Closures may refer to variables defined in a surrounding function (**free variables**). Those variables are then shared between the surrounding function and the closure, and they survive as long as they are accessible

Closed over variables **semantically** are always captured by address, meaning they escape to the heap  
However, internally, a closure can be passed a copy of a value (not the address) to reduce GC pressure. For example, if the value is a constant or is never modified

# Implementation

## Direct Call

A compiler rewrites a direct call of a function literal into a normal function call with closure variables passed as arguments. This avoids allocation of a closure object

For example, this call:

```go
func(a int) {
	println(byval)
	byref++
}(42)
```

becomes:

``` go
func(byval int, byref *int, a int) {
	println(byval)
	(*byref)++
}(byval, byref, 42)
```

## Function Values and Closure Object

Function values are pointers that point to structs. These structs contain either:

1. Just the pointer to the function code for simple functions
2. Pointers to an autogenerated wrapper function and receivers and/or function parameters in the case of method calls and closures

For example, this closure:

```go
func closure() func() *byte {
    var b [4096]byte
    return func() *byte {
        return &b[0]
    }
}
```

becomes:

```go

type closure_1_obj struct {
	F uintptr
	b *[4096]byte
}

func closure_1(p *closure_1_obj) *byte {
	return &p.b[0]
}

func closure() *struct{ F uintptr } {
	var b [4096]byte
	p := &closure_1_obj{
		F: &closure_1,
		b: &b,
	}
	return (*struct{ F uintptr })(unsafe.Pointer(p))
}
```
