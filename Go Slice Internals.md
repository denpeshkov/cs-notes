# Representation

Slices are represented by a `runtime.slice` struct (*slice header*):

```go
type slice struct {
	array unsafe.Pointer
	len   int
	cap   int
}
```

- `array` is a pointer to the underlying array
- `len` represents the length of a slice
- `cap` indicates the capacity of a slice

Note that, slice is *not* a pointer to a struct

## `nil` Slice

`nil` slice is actually a zero value of the slice header:

```go
slice {
	array: nil,
	len:   0,
	cap:   0,
}
```

## Empty Slice

Empty slice is just a slice with `len` and `cap` equal to 0 and `array` pointing to [zero-sized](Go%20Zero-Sized%20Values.md) array:

```go
slice {
	array: unsafe.Pointer(&zerobase),
	len:   0,
	cap:   0,
}
```

The value of the `array` is the address of the `runtime.zerobase`, the base address for all 0-byte allocations

# Grow Factor

The slices grow as follows:

```
const threshold = 256
if cap < threshold {
	cap = cap*2
} else {
	cap = cap + (cap + 3*threshold) / 4
}
```

So, the growth factor is roughly 2x for small slices and 1.25x for large slices, plus a constant for a smoother transition.

# Type Information

[Type information](Go%20Type%20Internals.md) about the slice data type is represented by an `abi.SliceType` struct:

```go
type SliceType struct {
	Type
	Elem *Type // slice element type
}
```

# Invariance and Conversions

Slices are invariant. This is one of the reasons why we can't convert `[]T` to an `[]interface{}`  
Another, is that memory layout of these two slices is different:

- Each `interface{}` takes up [two words](Go%20Interfaces%20Internals.md). As a consequence, a slice with length `N` and with type `[]interface{}` is backed by a chunk of data that is `N*2` words long
- This is different than the chunk of data backing a slice with type `[]MyType` and the same length. Its chunk of data will be `N*sizeof(MyType)` words long

---

- Converting a slice to an *array* yields an array containing the elements of the underlying array of the slice
- Converting a slice to an *array pointer* yields a pointer to the underlying array of the slice

In both cases, if the length of the slice is less than the length of the array, a panic occurs

Note that converting a `nil` slice to an array pointer yields a `nil` pointer, while converting an empty slice to an array pointer yields a non-`nil` pointer
