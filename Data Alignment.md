# Alignment Requirement

A memory address $A$ is $N$-byte aligned when $A$ is a multiple of $N$ (where $N$ is a power of 2)  
A data is naturally aligned when data's memory address is a multiple of the data size

The effects of performing an unaligned memory access vary from architecture to architecture:

- On some architectures unaligned accesses may not be supported
- Unaligned accesses may be [non-atomic](Atomic%20Instructions.md)
- Accesses that cross a [cache line](Cache%20Memory.md) boundary may cause a performance penalty because multiple lines need to be fetched
- Accesses that cross a [page](Virtual%20Memory.md) boundary may cause an even bigger performance penalty because multiple pages need to be fetched
- A DRAM typically supports only aligned [bursts](Main%20Memory.md)

# Satisfying Alignment Requirements

Alignment is enforced by making sure that every data type is organized and allocated in such a way that every object within the type satisfies its alignment restrictions

- Initial address of the object must be aligned. Starting address for any block generated by a memory allocator must be aligned
- Every field inside the object must be aligned
- Size of the object must be aligned to satisfy alignment for arrays of objects
- Stack frame must be aligned

For example, given the following struct:

```c
struct S {
	T1 f1
	T2 f2
	...
	Tn fn
}
```

The compiler ensures alignment by inserting padding, so that:

- Any pointer `p` of type `struct S*` points to an address that is a multiple of the size of the largest element type
- Each field `fi` is aligned, meaning the address of `fi` is a multiple of the size of `Ti`
- The total size of `struct S` is a multiple of the size of the largest element type, ensuring proper alignment for arrays of `S`

The compiler uses `.align` directives in the assembly code to enforce alignment for global data.
