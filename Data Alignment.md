# Alignment Requirement

A memory address $A$ is **$N$-byte aligned** when $A$ is a multiple of $N$ (where $N$ is a power of 2)  
A data is **naturally aligned** when data's memory address is a multiple of the data size

The effects of performing an unaligned memory access vary from architecture to architecture:

- On some architectures unaligned accesses may not be supported
- Unaligned accesses may be [non-atomic](Atomic%20Instructions.md)
- Accesses that cross a [cache line](Cache%20Memory.md) boundary may cause a performance penalty because multiple lines need to be fetched
- Accesses that cross a [page](Virtual%20Memory.md) boundary may cause an even bigger performance penalty because multiple pages need to be fetched.
- A DRAM typically supports only aligned [bursts](Main%20Memory.md)

# Satisfying Alignment Requirements

Alignment is enforced by making sure that every data type is organized and allocated in such a way that every object within the type satisfies its alignment restrictions

- Initial address of the object must be aligned. Starting address for any block generated by a memory allocator must be aligned
- Every field inside the object must be aligned
- Size of the object must be aligned to satisfy alignment for arrays of objects
- Stack frame must be aligned

For example, given this struct:

```c
struct S {
	T1 f1
	T2 f2
	...
	Tn fn
}
```

Where `Tmax` is the size of the biggest type `T1`…`Tn`

Compiler must ensure (by adding **paddings**) that:

- Any pointer `p` of type struct `S*` satisfies the alignment: `*p` is a multiple of `Tmax`
- Each element `fi` satisfies the alignment: `&fi` is a multiple of `Ti`
- Size of the `S` is a multiple of size of the biggest element's type

The compiler places directives `.align` in the assembly code indicating the desired alignment for global data
