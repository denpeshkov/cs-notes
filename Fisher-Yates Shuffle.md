# Algorithm

```
for i = 0 to n-2 do {
	j <- random integer such that 0 <= j < n
	swap(a[i], a[j])
}
```

# The "inside-out" Algorithm

```
for i = 0 to n-1 do {
	j <- random integer such that 0 <= j <= i
	swap(a[i], a[j])
}
```

The advantage of this technique is that **n**, the number of elements in the array, does not need to be known in advance

# Proof

#TODO

# Properties

Time complexity:

| Worst | Average | Best |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $\theta(N)$ | $\theta(N)$ | $\theta(N)$ |

Space complexity auxiliary:

| Worst | Average | Best |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $\theta(1)$ | $\theta(1)$ | $\theta(1)$ |

Online: Yes, for "inside-out" version
