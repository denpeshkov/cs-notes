# DDR4 SDRAM DIMM Organization

![DIMM organization|500](DIMM%20organization.png)

A **channel** is the physical connection between the memory controller and the DIMM, consisting of data and control/address buses. DDR4 DIMMs have a single channel, while DDR5 has two independent sub-channels per DIMM

A **rank** is a set of DRAM **chips** that share the same control/address and data buses and work together to service a command. Each chip supplies *8 bits*, so to fill a *64-bit* data bus, a single memory command results in responses from all eight chips in a rank

A DRAM chip consists of multiple **bank groups**. A prefetch is executed in one bank group, and another prefetch can be executed in another independent bank group, which reduces latencies compared to both commands executing in the same bank group

A **bank** within a bank group consist of a 2D memory array of **cells**, a **row decoder** and a **column decoder**. The array consists of rows, called **word lines** and columns, called **bit lines**. Each cell in the array stores *1 bit* of data

A row decoder selects a row, called an **opened row**, to be latched into the **sense amplifiers**. A column decoder select a starting column for the burst transfer of the data to the bus

# Accessing Memory

Read and write operations are a 2-step process. It begins with the `ACTIVATE` command, which is then followed by a `READ` or `WRITE` command

## Activation

The `ACTIVATE` command is used to activate (or open) a row in a particular bank for a subsequent access. It reads cells charges from a selected row into the sense amplifiers

The address bits registered coincident with the `ACTIVATE` command are used to select the bank group, the bank and the row. This row remains active for accesses until a `PRECHARGE` command is issued to that bank or all the banks. This step is also called **RAS** - Row Address Strobe

A bank must be pre-charged before opening a different row in the same bank

## Precharge

The `PRECHARGE` command is used to deactivate (precharge) the open row in a particular bank or the open row in all banks

Reading charge from the capacitors discharges them, destroying the information in each cell. The information must be put back into the DRAM array after an activation, otherwise the it is lost. Precharge is the process of deactivating the currently opened row and readying the DRAM to read data from a new row. It involves transferring the contents of the sense amplifiers back into the opened row's capacitors and resetting the bit-lines

The bank(s) will be available for a subsequent row activation a specified time after the `PRECHARGE` command is issued, except in the case of concurrent `AUTO PRECHARGE`, where a `READ` or `WRITE` command to a different bank is allowed as long as it does not interrupt the data transfer in the current bank

Once a bank has been pre-charged, it must be activated prior to any `READ` or `WRITE` commands being issued to that bank

## Read and Write

The `READ` command is used to read the data. The `WRITE` command is used to write the data

The address bits registered coincident with the `READ` or `WRITE` command are used to select the starting column location for the burst operation, determine if the `AUTO PRECHARGE` command is to be issued, and select the burst length. This step is also referred to as **CAS** - Column Address Strobe

# Prefetching and Burst Transfer

Each DRAM chip transfers 8-bits of data in one-half clock cycle. Each DIMM consist of 8 chips operating in parallel to transfer 64-bits of data in one-half clock cycle

Read and write operations are **burst** oriented. They allow a burst of data to be transferred, starting from the specified column, while the row is still open. For a burst length of eight, a single read or write operation consists of eight corresponding 8-bit wide, one-half clock cycle data transfers per DRAM chip

Using this technique, called **prefetching**, a [64-bytes](Memory%20Hierarchy%20and%20Locality.md) [cache line](Cache%20Memory.md) is transferred in 4 clock cycles by issuing a single read or write operation, utilizing all 8 DRAM chips in parallel. Without prefetching, each operation to a DRAM chip would select a starting column, possibly pre-charging a new row, to transfer a 8-bits of data

A burst data transfer always accesses an 8-bytes [aligned block](Data%20Alignment.md) of data. For example, a burst for any column address from 0 to 7 will return words from 0 to 7 in the specified burst order

# Banks Interleaving

To allow multiple [cache lines](Cache%20Memory.md) to be transferred in short succession, DDR4 uses **bank interleaving**

After a burst transfer is complete, a row in a bank has to be pre-charged (deactivated), and a new row activated. While one bank is busy handling pre-charge and activation, another bank can immediately start the burst transfer of the next cache line. This idea of interleaving allows for maintaining peak utilization of a shared data bus
