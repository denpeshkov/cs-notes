My personal collection of notes and resources that I am building as part of my public learning journey in computer science and software engineering

This digital garden helps me:

- Organize and structure my learning process
- Build connections between different topics I'm studying
- Share my insights in ways that can benefit others

While it serves as my personal study hub, it's also open for others to explore or contribute ideas
